## Introduction

This is not journalism as usual — it is a **public reckoning**.  
The *Collier Exposed* landing page serves as the central hub for our ongoing investigation into the life and legacy of **Stuart Collier**, a tabloid figure whose career embodied cruelty, deceit, and corruption.

From Fleet Street to the underworld, Collier’s activities expose the moral rot at the heart of Murdoch’s empire. This investigation seeks to document, verify, and preserve the record — permanently and publicly.

## Findings & Exposures

The investigation exposes a clear pattern of **sadism, coercion, and collusion** under the guise of journalism.  
Highlights from the *Exposures* series include:

- **Guppygate (1990)** — The fraudulent scandal engineered and exploited by **Stuart Collier**, whose blackmail tactics triggered the infamous call between *Darius Guppy* and *Boris Johnson*.  
- **The Daniel Morgan Murder (1987)** — Evidence positioning **Stuart Collier** as a liaison and fixer between corrupt police, private investigators, and Murdoch editors in the events leading to Morgan’s brutal killing.  
- **Media Corruption Networks** — Collier’s sustained collaboration with *Alex Marunchak*, *Sid Fillery*, *Jonathan Rees*, and *Clive Goodman*, showing systemic abuse of information pipelines, surveillance, and suppression of criminal evidence.  

Each exposure contributes to a mosaic of corruption — a record that the Murdoch press sought to conceal for decades.
