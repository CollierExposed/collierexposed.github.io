## Introduction

This is not journalism as usual â€” it is a **public reckoning**.  
The *Collier Exposed* landing page serves as the central hub for our ongoing investigation into the life and legacy of **Stuart Collier**, a tabloid figure whose career embodied cruelty, deceit, and corruption.

From Fleet Street to the underworld, Collierâ€™s activities expose the moral rot at the heart of Murdochâ€™s empire. This investigation seeks to document, verify, and preserve the record â€” permanently and publicly.

## Findings & Exposures

The investigation exposes a clear pattern of **sadism, coercion, and collusion** under the guise of journalism.  
Highlights from the Exposures series include:

- **Guppygate** â€” The fraudulent scandal engineered and exploited by **Stuart Collier**, whose blackmail tactics triggered the now-infamous 1990 call between *Darius Guppy* and *Boris Johnson*.  
- **The Daniel Morgan Murder** â€” Evidence positioning **Stuart Collier** as a liaison and fixer between corrupt police, private investigators, and Murdoch editors in the events leading to Morganâ€™s brutal 1987 killing.  
- **Media Corruption Networks** â€” Collierâ€™s sustained collaboration with *Alex Marunchak*, *Sid Fillery*, *Jonathan Rees*, and *Clive Goodman*, showing systemic abuse of information pipelines, surveillance, and suppression of criminal evidence.  

Each exposure contributes to a mosaic of corruption â€” a record that the Murdoch press sought to conceal for decades.
