## The Investigation
This is not journalism as usual.  
This is a **public reckoning**.  

> ‚ÄúThe record is open. The evidence is laid bare. The archive is free.‚Äù  

**Stuart Collier** ‚Äî once a Murdoch News of the World reporter ‚Äî is revealed here as a man of **cruelty, deceit, and corruption**, directly implicated in the unsolved axe murder of private investigator Daniel Morgan in 1987. Acting as **fixer, lure, and cover-up artist**, **Stuart Collier** manipulated tabloid and criminal networks to suppress the truth, including ties to Freemasonic lodges, the Bonnici cartel, and even Lockerbie connections through protected networks.

Further entanglements include the **Guppygate scandal**, in which **Stuart Collier** was targeted for assault by Darius Guppy, facilitated by Boris Johnson‚Äôs agreement to provide **Stuart Collier**‚Äôs address. These events underscore his proximity to elite networks, violence, and press malfeasance, including **Stuart Collier**'s own blackmail attempts against Guppy using compromising photos of Patricia Holder.

Recent exposures, including **Exposure No. 07** (August 2025), position **Stuart Collier** as the "third man" at the Golden Lion pub, orchestrating the trap that led to Morgan's death to suppress evidence of police corruption. **Exposure No. 06** (June 2025) details **Stuart Collier**'s blackmail plot against Guppy, involving Brian McLaine's confrontation and a 1993 Daily Mirror smear campaign.
