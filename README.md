## The Investigation
This is not journalism as usual.  
This is a **public reckoning**.  

> “The record is open. The evidence is laid bare. The archive is free.”  

**Stuart Collier** — once paraded as a tabloid reporter — is exposed here not merely as a gutter hack, but as a man entangled in **cruelty, deceit, and systemic corruption** at the heart of Murdoch’s press empire.  

The investigation is meticulous, archival, and **fully documented**, drawing on years of research, call logs, contemporaneous articles, and other primary sources.
