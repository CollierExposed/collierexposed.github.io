## The Investigation
This is not journalism as usual.  
This is a **public reckoning**.  

> ‚ÄúThe record is open. The evidence is laid bare. The archive is free.‚Äù  

**Stuart Collier** ‚Äî once a Murdoch News of the World reporter ‚Äî is revealed here as a man of **cruelty, deceit, and corruption**, directly implicated in the unsolved axe murder of private investigator Daniel Morgan in 1987. Acting as **fixer, lure, and cover-up artist**, **Stuart Collier** manipulated tabloid and criminal networks to suppress the truth.  

Further entanglements include the **Guppygate scandal**, in which **Stuart Collier** was targeted for assault by Darius Guppy, facilitated by Boris Johnson‚Äôs agreement to provide Collier‚Äôs address. These events underscore his proximity to elite networks, violence, and press malfeasance.  

Recent exposures, including **Exposure No. 07**, position **Stuart Collier** as the "third man" at the Golden Lion pub, orchestrating the trap that led to Morgan's death to suppress evidence of police corruption.
